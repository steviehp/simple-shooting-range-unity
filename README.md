# Shooting Range in Unity
This is a simple shooting range program I made in Unity.
***
I made this with the intention of learning C# and OOP while making a fun little exercise for FPS games.
How this program works is that:

* Theres an invisable area where dummy objects would be created with random X and Y coords.
* Once you click on the Start button 10 dummies will spawn and a timer will start.
* Dummy objects will be destroyed once you click on the sphere part representing a head.
* The timer will automatically stop once all 10 dummies are destroyed.
* You then would click the stop button and you are given the option to start the program all over again.
* There are no bullets and uses Raycasting instead of bullets to offer instant deletion to simplifiy the game.
